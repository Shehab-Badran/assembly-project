# assembly-project
This project is a calculator program built using MARIE Assembly Language. It performs fundamental arithmetic and mathematical operations, including:

✅ Addition & Subtraction – Handles basic arithmetic operations.
✅ Trigonometric Functions – Computes sin, cos, and tan values.
✅ Prime Number Check – Determines whether a number is prime.
✅ Even/Odd Check – Identifies if a number is even or odd.

The program efficiently processes user inputs and applies mathematical logic using MARIE's Load, Store, Add, Subt, and Branch instructions. It showcases basic control structures and memory management in MARIE Assembly Language.
